version 0
In this version I did basic page layouts with normal html and php codes

version 1
In this version I finally made sql setup and the data used were able to be stored in database and login was able to establish

But my code was not running in my friends system

version 2
In this version I finnaly linked the pages with basic buttons and links to easily navigate between pages and also started learning about docker to make my codes run in different systems

But docker is a completely different concept so needs some time to understand
