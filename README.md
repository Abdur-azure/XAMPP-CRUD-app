version 0
In this version, I did basic page layouts with normal HTML and PHP codes.

version 1
In this version, I finally made the SQL setup, and the data used was able to be stored in the database, and login was able to establish

But my code was not running on my friend's system.

version 2
In this version, I finally connected the pages with basic buttons and links to make it easier to navigate between them, and I also began learning about Docker to make my codes run on different systems.

But Docker is a completely different concept and needs some time to understand.

version 3
In this version, I have created an upload option to add images to MySQL, expecting to add tensor flow AI to fine tune the images.
Â 
Docker will be taken care of at last; now the main aim is to add Python and create sessions for users to have records of their uploads.
